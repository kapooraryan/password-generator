## Essentials
- Find the logic for the password generator in the [utils.js](src/components/utils.js) file.
- The words array makes use of airline names from [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/).
- The notifications for the application are sent out using [react-hot-toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/). <img src="https://github.com/kapooraryan/password-generator/assets/69362333/93ea4068-d607-4a75-a771-5f9562914f77">
- The passwords are saved to IndexedDB using Dexie.js.
